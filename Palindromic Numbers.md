A palindromic number is one that is the same when its digits are reversed.

For example:
- 98789 is a palindrome;
- 12344321 is a palindrome;
- 12345 is not a palindrome as it becomes 54321 when reversed.

Except for 0, a palindromic numberâ€™s leftmost digit must be non-zero.

**Write a program that reads in a positive integer of up to 20 digits. You should output the smallest palindromic number that is higher than the input.**

### Aditional Missions
What is the largest difference between a palindromic number (of up to 20 digits) and the next highest
palindromic number?

How many integers are there, between 1 and 99999 inclusive, that are not the sum of two palindromic
numbers?
